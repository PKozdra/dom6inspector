The caster of this spell revives a previously slain hero via the ancient Ritual of Rebirth. The ritual mummifies the dead hero before bringing him or her back to life. Only great heroes from the Hall of Fame can be resurrected by this ritual. The ritual can be performed multiple times on a single hero, should he have died again. Inanimate, undead (except mummies) and spiritform beings are not affected by this spell
