The caster chains the seven pillars of water to his god's command. Wherever the pretender god has influence water will rise up and strike down any heathens that plot against him.  Water in friendly dominion will animate and try to kill enemy commanders whenever possible. The elemental is stronger in provinces with a rich water supply than in dry provinces. A waste with no access to water will never get any attacks.
