In the prophecies of ##godnat## it is said that there will be a great war that will lead to the dominance of ##fullgodname## over all that is. During this great war ##godhe## will break the shackles that restrains the four winds, in roaring delight the four winds will savage the lands, uprooting trees and wrecking ships. Now the war is upon us, ##godname## has unleashed the four winds. Boreas, Eurus, Notus and Zephyr can all be heard roaring outside your halls, their fury heralds the ascendancy of ##godname##.
