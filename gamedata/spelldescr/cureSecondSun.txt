This must stop, the brazen display of power from ##godname## is beating down on your subjects and their lands, wilting their crops and drying out their rivers. How can your flock remain faithful when the sign of ##godname## is hanging so unopposed in the sky, dispelling shade but causing the shadow of doubt to darken the minds of your faithful. Tear down this insult that has been hung above your head, dispel this merciless light and usher back the coolness of the night.
