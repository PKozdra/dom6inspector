You are being watched. Your servants are being watched. Your slaves are being watched. The unblinking eyes of the lord of ##godnat## is ever watching your moves, peering over your shoulders, glaring at you from the sun, watching you from the shadows. By taking the first step towards omniscience ##godname## has set ##godhimself## upon a path, that if not blocked, will lead ##godhim## to ascension. Obviously there is only one fitting punishment for this grotesque arrogance, you must blind these ever-present eyes.
