From time to time seers skilled in the astral ways are visited by terrible dreams of a coming atrocity. An atrocity that will pour poison into the very veins of magic, pollute the astral wellsprings and call upon the slaves of unreason to prey upon seers, sages and sorcerers alike. That atrocity has now been committed, ##fullgodname## has performed an impure sacrifice of unheard magnitude, using the power of blood ##godhe## has twisted the fabric of magic itself filling it with the impure energies upon which the slaves of unreason feast. The sooth- and doomsayers wail and cry that this must be that terrible time of which the prophecies speak, the time when no magic can be safely practiced save for the impure path of blood, the time that ushers in the rule of ##godname##, the time of the reign of blood.
