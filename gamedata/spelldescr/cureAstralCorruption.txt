With one blow ##godname## has crippled much of your forces, your loyal mages brood useless in their towers dreading even to try the most basic of charms, your seers and soothsayers dare not gaze too long into the void lest they find eyes in the void gazing back at them. Such arrogance from the upstart of ##godnat##. Has ##godname## forgotten the treaty in which this abomination was forbidden? Your path is clear, purify the world from this taint, cleanse the world of this corruption, wash the world pure with the blood of ##godname##.
