An unnatural vigor has come upon the people of the world, their woes, their pains, their very mortality is being sucked away from them. The black lamb, ##fullgodname## has opened the well of misery, making ##godhimself## the sacrifice, drawing all ills to ##godhis## ##godthrone## providing false hopes to the righteously smitten. The coming of the black lamb of ##godnat## is one of the omens of the end. Unless the unholy well dries out the prophecies state that ##godname## will ascend the heavens and lock all pretenders' souls and bodies in the pit of Tartarus.
