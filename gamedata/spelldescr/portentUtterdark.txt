The last few seasons blind soothsayers have been roaming the street bemoaning the end of time and the coming slaying of the sun. Now the unthinkable has come to pass, the last sign of the end of all is upon us. The lord of ##disnat## has opened the gates to the shadow hell and made the sun an offering to its forces. Darkness covers the land, crops wither and die, and high and low alike hide from the things that go bump in the night. This is indeed a sign of the ascendancy of ##fullgodname## who shall lay waste to the world. Unless the other pretenders can pierce the shadow and reclaim the sun for their people all will be lost, and ##godname## will rule this world, and the next, from ##godhis## ##godthrone##.
