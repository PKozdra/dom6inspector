The Sun is the Watchful face of God in the Mictlan Cult. Unless sated with human sacrifices, it will look to other, more worthy followers. The Sun Priest is not as important as he was in earlier times. He wields priestly power and is skilled in Fire and Blood magic. Occasionally public ceremonies celebrating the Sun are performed by the Sun Priests attended by numerous lesser priests.
