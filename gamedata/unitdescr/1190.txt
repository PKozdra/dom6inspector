Priest Kings are the temporal leaders of the kingdom. They bless the Land with fertility and lead the people. With the coming of the Lawgiver, they have become more influential and are the highest ranking priests in the kingdom together with the High Priests of the Sky. They lead the people in accordance with the laws of the Sky Priests. Occasionally public ceremonies celebrating the life giving Land are performed by the Priest Kings attended by numerous lesser priests.
The Priest King wields priestly power and is skilled in Nature magic. He can levy slave warriors.
