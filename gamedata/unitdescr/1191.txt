The Rain is important in the Mictlan Cult. With the coming of the Lawgiver, Rain Priests have given up Blood magic. The Rain Priest wields priestly power and is skilled in Water magic. Occasionally public ceremonies celebrating the life-giving Rain are performed by the Rain Priests attended by numerous lesser priests.
