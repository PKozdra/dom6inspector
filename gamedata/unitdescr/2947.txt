The Ereshdingir is a high priestess of the Moon, second only to the Entu herself. Once there was but one Temple of the Moon, but now every city state has its own lunar temple, led by an Ereshdingir. Public ceremonies are still held at the great temples of the kingdom, but are now limited to the grand ceremonies of the moon cult.
