In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. At the heart of the vast compound lies The House of Water, the high temple to the Wise Principle of the Waters Underground. Here priests and sacred warriors are trained. The Ishib is a priest of the House of Water. He performs the sacred libations of the temple cult and is skilled in Water magic. Religion in Ur is a public affair and occasionally grand ceremonies led by the Entu and Ensi are held at a temple pyramid for all to witness. During these great events every Ishib is expected to join the processions and rituals to enhance the significance of the ceremony. In remote areas the Ishib priests will take the role of the royal couple and lead the grand ceremonies.
