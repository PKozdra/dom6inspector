Since the first contact with Hinnom, the populace of Berytos has worshiped the Melqarts as gods and lords of their cities. In every newly founded colony a great temple will be raised in honor of their Melqart. The priests lead the sacrificial rites of the faith and keep the temple pyres burning. During the grand ceremonies at the capital all priest gather and join the presiding Bride-in-Waiting to enhance the influence of her ritual casting.
