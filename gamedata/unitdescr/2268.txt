In the center of the First City lies an enormous temple ground. Here priests and sacred warriors are trained. The Gudu is a sacrificial priest. He performs the bloodless offerings to the God. The Gudu is trained in one of the lesser divine aspects, Earth and Air. The Gudu is a priest of lesser status than the Ishib. Religion in Ur is a public affair and occasionally grand ceremonies led by the Entu and Ensi are held at a temple pyramid for all to witness. During these great events every Gudu is expected to join the processions and rituals to enhance the significance of the ceremony. In remote areas the Gudu priests occasionally lead the grand ceremonies.
