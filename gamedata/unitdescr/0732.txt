The Priest Kings are the temporal leaders of the kingdom. They bless the Land with fertility and lead the people. The Priest King wields priestly power and is skilled in Nature and Blood magic. He can levy slave warriors. Occasionally public ceremonies celebrating the life-giving Land are performed by the Priest Kings attended by numerous lesser priests.
