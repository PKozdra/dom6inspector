The Sun is the Watchful Face of God in the Mictlan Cult. Unless sated with human sacrifices, it will look to other, more worthy followers. The High Priest of the Sun is the most important of all priests of the Empire. His authority outweighs even the authority of the Priest Kings. Occasionally public ceremonies celebrating the Moon are performed by the High Priest of the Sun attended by numerous lesser priests.
 The High Priest is skilled in Fire magic and is a powerful priest and Blood mage.
